Ollama provider for the WordPress AI Client.

== Description ==

This plugin provides [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) integration for the WordPress AI Client. It lets WordPress sites use large language models running locally or on a remote Ollama instance for text and image generation and other AI capabilities.

Ollama exposes an [OpenAI-compatible API](https://ollama.com/blog/openai-compatibility), and this provider uses that API to communicate with any model you have pulled into Ollama (Llama, Mistral, Gemma, Phi, and many more).

**Features:**

* Text generation with any Ollama model
* Image generation with supported models
* Automatic model discovery from your Ollama instance
* Function calling support
* Structured output (JSON mode) support
* Settings page for host URL and seeing available models
* Works without an API key for local instances

**Requirements:**

* PHP 7.4 or higher
* WordPress 7.0 or higher
* Ollama running locally or on a remote server (like Ollama Cloud)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/ai-provider-for-ollama/`.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to **Settings > Ollama** to configure the host URL and see available models.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I install Ollama? =

Visit [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/) to download and install Ollama for your platform. Once installed, pull a model (example `ollama pull llama3.2`) and the provider will automatically discover it.

= Do I need an API key? =

No. For local Ollama instances, no API key is needed. The plugin automatically handles authentication for local setups.

For remote Ollama instances that require authentication, enter the API key in the **Settings > Connectors** screen. If using Ollama Cloud, you also need to set your Ollama host URL in the **Settings > Ollama** screen to `https://ollama.com`.

= How do I change the Ollama host URL? =

By default, the provider connects to `http://localhost:11434`. You can change this in two ways:

1. Set the `OLLAMA_HOST` environment variable (takes precedence).
2. Go to **Settings > Ollama** in the WordPress admin and enter your host URL.
